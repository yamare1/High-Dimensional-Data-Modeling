# High Dimensional Data Modeling: A Case Study on Crime Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project applies **feature selection and regression techniques** to analyze high-dimensional data, using the **Communities and Crime dataset**. By implementing **Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regularization**, we identify the most predictive features and optimize model performance. 

## 📊 Methods Used
- **Feature Selection:** Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, Best Subsets, Recursive Feature Selection
- **Predictive Modeling:** Linear Regression, Regularization Path Analysis, Model Validation
- **Optimization:** Cross-validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Performance Evaluation
- **Empirical Demonstrations:** Regression properties with correlated features, bias-variance tradeoff analysis
