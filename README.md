# High-Dimensional-Data-Modeling: A Case Study on Crime Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project applies **feature selection and regression techniques** to analyze high-dimensional data, using the **Communities and Crime dataset**. By implementing **Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regularization**, we identify the most predictive features and optimize model performance. 

While this study focuses on crime rate prediction, these **machine learning techniques are widely used in biomedical imaging** for identifying biomarkers in MRI and PET scans.

## 📊 Methods Used
- **Feature Selection:** Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, Best Subsets, Stepwise Regression
- **Predictive Modeling:** Linear Regression, Regularization Path Analysis, Model Validation
- **Optimization:** Cross-validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Performance Evaluation

## 🚀 Key Findings
- **Feature selection improves model interpretability** and avoids overfitting.
- **Regularization techniques help stabilize high-dimensional models**, making them more robust.
- The **same statistical techniques are commonly applied in MRI/PET imaging** to identify relevant biomarkers.

## 📂 Data
This project uses the **Communities and Crime dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.
